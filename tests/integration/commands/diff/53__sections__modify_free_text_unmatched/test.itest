RUN: %strictdoc diff %S/lhs %S/rhs

RUN: cat %S/Output/changelog.html | filecheck %s --dump-input=fail --check-prefix=CHECK-CHANGELOG

NOTE: The LHS and RHS Sections do not have a UID, so StrictDoc cannot match that
      it is just one node that is being changed. The expectation is that there
      will be two nodes modified: one removed and one added.
CHECK-CHANGELOG:2 nodes modified
